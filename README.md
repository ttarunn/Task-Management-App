## Task Management App

This is a simple Task Management application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The project is divided into two main components:

# Backend

The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js, and it provides a RESTful API for managing tasks. Here are the main functionalities of the backend:

- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations: The API supports CRUD operations for tasks. Each task has attributes like id, title, and description.

- Validation: When creating a task, the API ensures that the task title is not empty. Validation errors are handled gracefully, and appropriate error responses are returned.

- Database: The application uses MongoDB (or MySQL or PostgreSQL) as the database to store task data.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks. Here are the main functionalities of the frontend:

- Task List: Users can view a list of tasks retrieved from the backend API. The list displays task titles.

- CRUD Operations: Users can perform CRUD operations on tasks directly from the UI. They can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.

- Forms: The application includes forms for adding new tasks and editing existing tasks. Input field validation is implemented to provide feedback for any validation errors.

- API Interaction: Axios is used to interact with the backend API, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-app.git

- Backend Setup: Navigate to the backend directory and follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up and run the backend server.

- Frontend Setup: Navigate to the frontend directory and follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up and run the frontend application.

- Start the Application: Start both the backend and frontend servers. You can now access the Task Management App by opening it in your web browser.

# Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (or MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- Frontend: React, Axios

This Task Management App is a great starting point for learning full-stack web development with Node.js, Express.js, React, and a database of your choice. Feel free to customize and expand it to suit your specific project needs.
